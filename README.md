# ElevatorEmulator
A program that emulates the functionality of an elevator.  

To run the program:

1) Open the .sln folder with Visual Studio 2022.
2) At the top of the screen, press the green play button.  A console will open up.
3) The console will accept certain input.  Acceptable input includes numbers between one and ten that can be followed by a U or a D.  Valid input examples include 1D, 2U, 5D, 1, and 7.
4) Once done with the program, press Q to quit.  The program will finish after the elevator has visited all the floors.  
5) The program also produces logs.  These can be found in the ElevatorEmulator\bin\Debug\net6.0\Logs folder.  There, both elevator activity as well as user input is recorded.

To run the unit tests:

1) Open the .sln folder with Visual Studio 2022.
2) At the top of the window, open the "Test" drop down menu, and click on the "Test Explorer" button.  
3) At the top left corner, press the "Run All Tests in View" button.
4) The tests will now run.  Expect the tests to take about 12 minutes.
